# Greetings, Trailblazer! üëã

I am Manikant Thakur, sculpting my professional journey as a:

**DEVOPS/ML OPS ALCHEMIST ¬∑ CLOUD ARCHITECT EXTRAORDINAIRE ¬∑ DATA/ML EXPLORER ¬∑ INFOSEC ENIGMATIST**

Embarking on the next phase during the "Parental Break," each day reveals a new chapter in my professional and personal story.

# üçº Journey into Parenthood

As I transitioned into parenthood, I underwent a profound learning experience that significantly impacted my personal and professional growth:

## üå± Patience and Professional Growth

- **Seeking Support:** Recognizing that asking for assistance is a strength, I learned to value collaboration and be open to the support of others.

- **Setting Achievable Goals:** Striking a balance between ambition and realism, I established challenging yet attainable objectives for myself and those around me, navigating this transformative journey with patience and determination.

- **Adaptability:** Embracing the unpredictability of parenthood, I became adept at handling unforeseen challenges, understanding that not everything can be meticulously planned. This adaptability extends seamlessly into my professional endeavors.

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Perseverance and Thriving as a Family

- **Resilience:** Navigating the challenges of recovery, sleepless nights, and mastering the intricacies of fatherhood, I not only overcame obstacles but thrived as a united family unit.

- **Recognizing Achievements:** Fostering a mental model of acknowledging and celebrating both significant and minor victories has proven to be an invaluable asset, contributing to personal and professional empowerment.

## ‚è∞ Effective Time Management

- **Priority-Setting:** Concentrating on what truly matters, even amidst challenges, has been a guiding principle. Our two-month campervan adventure exemplified the importance of simplicity and a pragmatic approach.

- **Focus and Planning:** Acknowledging the significance of prioritizing tasks, especially combating the challenges of the infamous "dad brain," I've developed a proactive approach to planning and communication, ensuring a balanced and efficient life‚Äîboth at work and home.

## üåø Embracing Simplicity

- **Appreciating Simplicity:** Reveling in the joy of simplicity, I've come to understand that, more often than not, we don't need as much as we might think. This appreciation extends into both personal and professional aspects of my life.

This journey into parenthood has enriched my life, instilling qualities that seamlessly integrate into my professional approach. It has been a testament to adaptability, perseverance, and effective time management, shaping me into a more resilient and accomplished individual in both my personal and professional endeavors.
